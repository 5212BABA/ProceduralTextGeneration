# Procedural Text Generator
This unity project contains different approaches and datasets to procedurally generate words of a certain type. All implementations are custom-made without the use of external libraries.

Currently there are 3 different generation methods: Markov Chains, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and a "Person Generator"

# How to Use
To test the generators, simply run the projects and apply the filters and settings to the generators.
